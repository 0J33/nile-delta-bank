# ![logo](markdown-logo.svg) Nile Delta Bank - Software Engineering Project

You can preview our website through our [deployed version](https://nile-delta-bank.vercel.app/).

This website was fully designed by us. No templates used :)

## To access all pages (Client, Banker & Admin)

When logging in through the login page, using the following credentials to access their corresponding pages:

| Page | Email | Password
| -- | -- | --
| Client | client@client.com| client
| Banker | banker@banker.com| banker
| Admin | admin@admin.com| admin

## Running it locally

This is a React app, and we're using technologies like redux, formik and more. So you first need to run `npm install` in the project directory, and then you can start the local server by running `npm start`
